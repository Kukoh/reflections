1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    when I want to use Github to collarboate with other people.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	since if git automatically stay up-to-date with my remote repository, the changes could be not logical.
