1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    when I want to use Github to collarboate with other people.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	since if git automatically stay up-to-date with my remote repository, the changes could be not logical.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	fork is to copy a repository on GitHub;
	clone is to copy a repository from GitHub to the local computer, or to copy a repository from a spot to another spot in the local computer;
	branches happen inside the repository;

	When you want to save time not to pull and push a repository on GitHub, you can use fork;
	When you want to copy a repository from the GitHub and operate on the local computer, you can use clone;
	When you want to operate inside the repository to try an experimental change, you can use branches.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	Having a copy of the last know state of the remote stored locally can help you to do the detect and merge the conflicts offline.

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Without git or github, I may work with google docs, that's more easier for people without basic knowledge of git or github. While now that I have knew about git and github, I think it is quite a systematic way to collaborate, and there's a guarder in terms of the function of pull request.
